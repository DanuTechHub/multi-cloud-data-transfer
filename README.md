# Multi-Cloud Data Transfer with AWS and GCP

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to transfer data from **Amazon S3** to **Google Cloud Storage** using **GCP's Storage Transfer Service**.

## What I Learned
- **Services Used**: Amazon S3, GCP Cloud Storage, Storage Transfer Service, IAM roles.
- **Key Concepts**: Multi-cloud data transfer, identity federation, storage class optimization.

## Process:
1. Set up **S3 bucket** on AWS and upload files.
2. Set up **GCP account**, create **Cloud Storage bucket**, and configure **Storage Transfer Service**.
3. **Created custom IAM roles** to enable secure data transfer between AWS and GCP.
4. Successfully verified data transfer from **AWS S3 to GCP**.

## Why I Did This Project
I chose to do this project today to **learn about multi-cloud data transfers** and gain hands-on experience with AWS and GCP.  
NextWork could improve by offering **more interactive labs and real-world challenges**.
